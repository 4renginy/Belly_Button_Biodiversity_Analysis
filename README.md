# PlotlyBellyButtonBiodiversity

## Purpose;

Helping navel sample providers to find out what kind of fungus their body produced and if their samples used to produce the bacteria and giving data points to fellow scientists to see the resutls.

Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more still remain unknown the science,  as a prominent microbiological labaratory we want do discover different bacterias and document them. Particularly we are interested in bacterial species that have ability to syntysise proteins that tests like beef. Recently we have partnered with Improbably beef to research candidate the species. 
 
Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algea, fungi, and microorganizms found on plantroots. However imporabable beef is still searching for a better alternative for best taste. One of those alternatives would be human body.
 
 
Human body is a source of a thousands of types of bacteria harbored by different parts of the body, furthermore those bacterias differs from person to person. Our hypostesis is may be the ideal bacterial species to make the sythetic beef found in the belly button. To test that our leading scientist we have sampled the navels of pople across the country to identify the bacterial species colonized in our bellybuttons.

## Method;

 Naturally each persons identity is anynomus instead they have been given id numbers and our job is to create a dasboard for the sample providers and fellow researchers to access   the information. 
 
 Such a dasboard requires buttons, dropdown menus, lists and charts however regular html wont do what we need to do so we decided to use javascript and html together.
 
 On this page the provider will be able to choose their id number from dorpdown menu and see all the information about themselves and what kind of bacterias found in their          body. 
       index.html is the web page code to present the information.
       style.css gave the page touch of charachter.
       Charts.js is the code to populate the necessary information

 I hope you enjoy the page as much as we enjoyed creating it.
